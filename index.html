                <p><span class="first-character">D</span>ata Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of efficient problem-solving in computer science. Data structures are ways of organizing data so that operations like search, insertion, and deletion can be performed efficiently. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures that use these structures to solve specific problems. Mastering DSA allows developers to write optimized code and solve complex computational challenges.</p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Topics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, and searching algorithms play a crucial role in technical interviews and competitive programming. A strong grasp of DSA not only enhances coding skills but also helps in understanding system design and software performance. It is essential for students preparing for roles at top tech companies, as it tests both logic and analytical skills.</p>

                <p><span class="first-character">W</span>eb Development involves building websites and applications that run on browsers and devices connected to the Internet. It includes everything from designing user interfaces to handling backend server operations. Web developers use various languages and frameworks to create responsive, interactive, and visually appealing websites tailored to different needs and users.</p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">The core technologies include HTML for content structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Backend development often uses languages like PHP, Node.js, or Python, paired with databases such as MySQL or MongoDB. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Bootstrap streamline development. Full-stack developers manage both front-end and back-end, ensuring smooth user experiences and functional systems.</p>
